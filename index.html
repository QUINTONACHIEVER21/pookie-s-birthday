        <h1>Happy JORDAN Birthday POOKIE </h1>

        <p>
          Happy Birthday. 23rd birthday Pookie❤️ a number that, at first glance, appears modest, almost unassuming, yet carries with
          it an extraordinary depth when one pauses long enough to truly consider it, from the 23 pairs of chromosomes humans have, the
          23 seconds blood takes to circulate through the human body or even better the fusion of 23 flavours in a can of Dr Pepper😂😂
          . Today marks not merely the passage of time, but the quiet accumulation of moments that have shaped you into the woman you are
          ,thoughtful, kind, and profoundly rare. I find myself reflecting on how fortunate I am that our paths have intersected, 
          and how your presence has subtly, yet undeniably, enriched my life in ways I continue to fathom more clearly with each passing day.

          There are people who enter one’s life loudly, demanding attention, and then there are those who arrive gently, leaving an imprint
          not through force, but through constancy. You are unmistakably the latter. Your presence carries a calm assurance, a warmth that doesn’t
          seek recognition yet never goes unnoticed. I appreciate you not only for the joy you bring, but for the sense of steadiness you offer, 
          the kind that reminds one that life, despite its chaos, can still be grounded in sincerity and care. Your..., ntho mahn eish, khana keng ndwe,
          eish just scan the code I'm out of ink😂😂😭😭
        </p>

        <p>
          Sorry I lost my train of thought pookie😭😭, but essentially I wanted to say that, ...Your kindness is not the superficial
          sort that exists for appearance’s sake. It is deliberate. Considered. Rooted in empathy.
          You possess a caring heart that does not simply react, but understands. You listen, truly listen, and in doing so,
          you make me feel valued, heard, and safe. That, I have learned, is a rare currency in this world, and you give it freely.
          I hope you never underestimate the quiet power of that gift, nor the lives it touches in ways you may never fully witness.
          As it has with me during some of the darkest days of my life, mostly mjolo but the fact is they were dark😭😂😂😂.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          As you turn 23, I hope you allow yourself the grace to recognise just how much you have already become.
          This is an age balanced delicately between knowing and discovering, between confidence and curiosity. I hope this
          year grants you clarity where you seek it, patience where you need it, and joy in places you least expect.
          May it unfold gently, without urgency, and reward you for the effort you so consistently invest in others (me especially others can go to heaven😭😂). 
        </p>

        <p>
          I want you to know this, with absolute certainty, that I will remain present in your life. Not fleetingly.
          Not conditionally. But deliberately. Presence, after all, is not measured by proximity alone, but by intention.
          By choosing, time and again, to show up, in moments both significant and mundane☺️❤️. Whether in celebration or quiet reflection,
          I am here, and I intend to remain so. We'll never fall apart like that code that's driving me crazy😭😂.

        </p>

        <p>
          I deeply appreciate the space you occupy in my life. You bring a sense of balance, a perspective that is both thoughtful and grounding.
          Your existence has added value to my days, not through grand gestures, but through consistency, warmth, and authenticity.
          You remind me that connection does not need to be complicated to be meaningful; it simply needs to be real.
        </p>

        <p>
          And now, if you’ll indulge me in a small digression, a birthday, after all, should never be entirely devoid of amusement.
          You are in your JORDAN year (lenna but this is not about me)😂😂😂. Individually distinct of Dr Pepper, yet somehow harmonising into something 
          unexpectedly delightful. I find this comparison rather fitting. Like those 23 flavours, you are layered,
          multifaceted, impossible to reduce to a single note. Sweet at times, bold at others, occasionally surprising, yet always unmistakably yourself.
          So yes, please make sure you taste all those fused flavours and tell me what they are😂😂😂😂.
        </p>

        <p>
          But humour aside, what matters most is this: you deserve to be celebrated, sincerely and without reservation.
          You deserve love that is patient, appreciation that is spoken aloud, and moments that remind you of your worth
          when the world grows loud and demanding. I hope you continue to move through life with the same compassion that
          defines you, while also granting yourself the same gentleness you so readily offer others. I once promised to buy 
          you truck load of book, and plan is still in action but for now enjoy these 4. Some things in life are beautifully 
          twisted, not broken, not chaotic, just shaped by experience in a way that makes them more compelling. Stories,
          hearts, destinies. After reading this you'll understand that love that isn’t neat, characters who aren’t simple,
          emotions that don’t follow rules but still lead you exactly where you’re meant to be (not that I read it and stuffs
          , i just read the summary😂😂😂). Each book is a reminder that sometimes the most meaningful connections are forged
          in complexity, where strength meets vulnerability, where flaws become depth, and where passion refuses to be ordinary.
          One thing I'd pray for is God to twist our lives and journeys to forever cross.❤️
        </p>
          
        <p>
          So here we are, at the beginning of your 23rd chapter. May it be filled with experiences that challenge
          and reward you, with laughter that lingers, and with memories that one day you will look back on fondly.
          Thank you for being exactly who you are, for your kindness, your care, and your presence in my life. Happy Birthday.
          May this year treat you with the same generosity of spirit that you bring into the world every single day.
        </p>

        <p>
          You’ll Never Walk Alone ❤️  
          Not today. Not this year. Not ever.

          Your Pookie❤️

        </p>
